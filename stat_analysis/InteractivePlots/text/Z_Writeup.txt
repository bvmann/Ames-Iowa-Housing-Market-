Different zoning practices have a large impact on the median prices of houses. Unsurprisingly, commercial makes up the very lowest tier of property value, followed by low and medium-level residential houses. Interestingly, the highest median sales price goes to the Floating Village zone, reserved for larger retirement communities. It might be that because FV housing can only be developed on a small proportion of the town proper that its value is so increased.
