Most sale types are within a narrow margin of one another, and so are not necessarily a good factor to weigh heavily into predicting home prices. However, two sales types stand out: Median prices on new houses and contracts with 15% down are more expensive by at least 60k than other sale types. New houses seems obvious, but the median value in the standard contract sale type is even higher. This is probably because non-standard contracts or low-interest plans are not often used for higher-value homes.
