# Final-Project-Ames-Iowa-Property-Learning

# Kaggle Project

This is a Kaggle challenge we did for University of Oregon Data Analytics Bootcamp as our final group project. The original project challenge can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data  The purpose of the challenge was to complete a machine learning model using either R or Python to predict housing prices in Ames,Iowa using 79 different variables. This data was collected by Dean DeCook of Truman State University and included 2390 observations of houses sold between 2006 and 2010. 

We have deployed this Heroku app to create a website which gives statistics on housing prices in the city of Ames, Iowa as well as hosting a machine-learning model that predicts housing prices. We hope this tool will provide valuable insights into general housing trends and the city of Ames specifically. 

Sales data is broken down on the Charts page by zoning, neighborhood and other factors, illustrating the influence of different factors on median housing price and filling in the data using D3. The Predictions page uses user input to make a prediction on a hypothetical sale. All the data is stored locally to the repo on CSVâ€™s, as well as in an SQLite database.
