One of the first relationships I charted in belief it would show a strong correlation was the area of the lot being sold compared to the price of the sale. In my head, even with differences in neighborhoods, the expensive neighborhoods of Ames couldn't be expensive enough to be out-pricing larger homes to a significant extent. This proved incorrect, as there is only a correlation of .47 (the line of regression couldn't be drawn by Plotly). In fact, the most expensive lots peak around 25k square feet, and the largest lots are barely halfway as costly. Although all these properties are within city limits, it seems apparent that Ames' outlying lots are significantly larger and cheaper than homes in its nicer neighborhoods.
